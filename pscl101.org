  Intro: stand up, pat your head, jump up and down.  Why did we do that?
  Because the person we thought was the professor told us to.  A bunch of social
  and cognitive "stuff" goes into that.

  Optical illusion pictures - the ones you can see multiple ways.  Your mind
  takes information, organizes, combines, and interprets things in different
  ways.  The same thing happens when you go to movies and discuss them with
  friends.  Or when you relate an experience to someone else.

  Apparently we need iClickers, which sound like another racket.  You can create
  a polling website that you can log into with Case ID's very simply and easily,
  even with Google Docs.  But instead they require students to purchase $40
  remotes!

  Anyway, we did a bunch of iClicker questions.  They were all false.  Then we
  had half of the class look at common sayings and say how many they agree with.
  Then the other half looked at common sayings that mean the opposite, and do
  the same.  The illustration was that we think Psychology is common sense, but
  things we believe to be common sense are frequently wrong.

  Empiricism: the belief that accurate knowledge of the world requires
  observation of it.

  So do research.

  The article we were supposed to read made conclusions on 12 weeks of data from
  a full year study.  So that's bad.

  Elements of the Scientific Process (according to PSCL 101):
  - Theory - a logically consistent model that is supported by data
  - Hypothesis - a proposed explanation for something
  - Variables

* 2016-01-20 Wednesday

  Still doing "scientific method" stuff.
  - Independent Variable - factor assumed to influence
  - Dependent Variable - factor expected to change as a result of the
    independent variable

  Need to "operationally define" what I mean by the variables.  Define in terms
  of what you're going to do in your experiment.

  - Operational definitions: statements that describe the exact operation or
    method used to define each variable

  Descriptive Research:
  - Case studies
  - Naturalistic observation
  - Survey research

  Correlational Research: determines the degree to which variables are related
  - Correlation coefficient (r) ranges from -1 to 1.

  Wait.  Correlation /isn't/ causation??  My world is *shattered.*

  We're going to talk about the brain and the things that go on in it.

  - Cerebral cortex - outer portion of the brain, roughly 80%.  Contains
    millions of nerves (neurons)
  - Neuron - basic cell that specializes in electrically transmitting
    information through the brain
    - Cell body - makes new components, etc.
    - Dendrite - tendrils coming off the cell body, they receive information
      from other cells.
    - Axon - a *longer* branch from the cell body, which transmits information
      to other cells.
    - Myelin Sheath - helps speed up/insulate the transmission of impulses
    - At the end of the axon (the terminal buttons), you find Synapses
    - When a signal "fires" through the axon, some chemicals are released which
      cross the synapse and start the impulse in the next neuron
  - Neural Communication
    - Within the neuron, transmission is electrical
    - Between the neurons, transmission is chemical
  - Neurotransmitters
    - Serotonin - regulates mood and depression, appetite, sleep, sensory stuff
      - People who suffer from depressions frequently report disruptions in
        appetite and sleep
    - Acetylcholine - involved in voluntary movement, learning, sleep
      - Too much can be associated with depression
      - Too little in the hippocampus (?) can be associated with dimensia
    - Dopamine - makes you feel "good" - part of the "reward system".  Also
      involved with motor control.
    - Endorphins - part of pain management system
      - painkillers are similar in structure to endorphins
  - Three types of neurons:
    - Sensory neurons
    - Motor neurons
      - mirror: "feel" what other people are feeling, empathy, etc.
    - Interneurons
  - Nervous System
    - Central Nervous System (CNS) = nerves within the brain and spinal cord
    - Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) = nerves outside brain and spinal cord
      - Somatic or Voluntary (skeletal muscles)
      - Autonomic (smooth and cardiac muscles and glands)
        - Parasympathetic branch (homeostasis, daily maintenance)
        - Sympathetic branch (alert system)
  - Major areas of the brain
    - forebrain
      - frontal lobe - planning, organizing, "executive functions", emotions,
        social judgements, etc
      - temporal lobe -
      - parietal lobe - sensory & perceptual info,
      - occipital lobe -
    - midbrain
      - helps respond to visual/audio stimuli with muscle movements
      - some memory
    - hindbrain - most primitive, but essential part of the brain
      - regulates air, blood, consciousness, etc.
  - We have those "lobes" on both sides of the brain, but we also have two
    "hemispheres"
    - each side is responsible for the opposite side's motion.
    - Left Hemisphere: language & speech, motor functions of the right hand &
      leg, sensory functions of the right hand & leg;
      - infants will do more thumb sucking when language is heard in their right
        ear (which is sent to the left hemisphere)
    - Right Hemisphere: spatial & non-verbal, (plus motor/sensory functions of
      left side).
      - Aprosodia - condition where you are unable to detect or produce
        intonation and tones in people's voices.
        - damaged right frontal lobe = you can't "produce" variation
        - damaged right temporal lobe = you can't interpret/receive this
          variation.
    - Corpus callosum - a band of fibers through which information can be
      transferred between hemispheres

  - Do not need to request an account, one already is set up.
  - Password is "psychology" (D:)
  - Need 7 hours, can do experiments or papers.

  Brain Plasticity
  - Your brain can adapt/change.
  - Experiment on rats: three environments: impoverished, standard, enriched.
    - In the enriched environments, the rats developed thicker, heavier
      cortexes, larger neurons, bigger ratio of RNA to DNA, and other things.
  - Can even adapt to missing hemisphere of brain, if removed young enough.

  Friday:
  - 25 multiple choice (wow :P)
  - 20 minutes.
  - Study guidelines, etc, on blackboard.

  Three Principles of Sensation & Perception
  - Adaptive processes
    - once you see something a certain way (eg. the cow picture), it's hard to
      see it any other way
  - Discrepancy between physical & psychological
  - Active processes
    - changes as you look

  Gestalt Principles of Form Perception
  - Similarity - We group things by their similarity to each other
  - Proximity - we group things by their proximity
  - Good continuation - we combine things into larger items
  - Simplicity
  - Common Fate - as things move, if they move together, we perceive them as a
    single unit.
  - Closure - we tend to interpret things with depth and "close" shapes

  Perceptual Constancy
  - Color - tendency to perceive an object's color as stable even though they're
    changing.  EG the colors due to light and shadow are different, but we
    perceive them as th same because we compensate for the shadow.
  - Shape - the tendency for an object's shape to appear consistent and
    constant.  The examples here were all objects in different 3D orientations,
    but we perceive them as all the same shape.
  - Size - again, we compensate for depth in images, and we make adjustments for
    size.

  Depth Perception
  - we will have a guest lecturer in the next class
* 2015-02-03 Wednesday

  Depth Perception, by Dr. Bendis

  Depth Perception
  - Reality is about perception.
  - Perception is about putting together cues.

  Types of Cues
  - Oculomotor Cues
    - Physical
    - Muscular contractions in the eye
    - Biological feedback to th ebrain
    - Kinesthetic cues
  - Visual cues
    - from the images
    - Interpreted by the brain
  - Binocular Cues
  - Monocular Cues
  - Static Cues
  - Motion Cues

  Retinal Disparity / Binocular Parallax
  - Woah.  It's like your eyes aren't in the same place.
  - Your brain takes two images and combines them into a 3D image.
  - This is called "stereopsis"
  - It's the biggest, but not the only part of depth perception
  - Convergence: the closer something is, the more your eyes bend together.

  Accomodation
  - If you change focus near/far, you'll feel it in your eyes.

  Perspective
  - Linear: parallel lines appear to converge in the distance.
  - Texture: more detailed up close, smaller far away
  - Atmospheric:
    - Blueish tint.
    - Haze
  - Aerial: the higher something is (in your field of view), the farther away it
    is.

  Shadows and Shading
  - We're talking about this in intro to film too, so it must be pretty
    important.

  Relative Brightness

  Motion Parallax
  - It's like trees from a car.

  Metamers
  - When two things are perceptually identical.
  - For example, small box and large box - are they in the same plane, or in
    different planes with the same size.

  Illusions
  - We're doing lots of them.  It's somewhat fun.
* 2015-02-05 Friday

  - Attention - the gateway to conscious awareness
  - Stimulus Thresholds:
    - Absolute Threshold - 50/50, where we may be able hear it, but it's not
      more likely than not.
    - Difference Threshold - level at which we can detect a change in the input
  - Signal detection: perceptual judgment = sensory processes + decision
    processes.

* 2015-02-10 Wednesday

  Quiz 2 was today.

  Music (especially in movies) has emotional effects.  We can learn to associate
  what happens in music with what happens on screen.  Then next time we hear the
  music we physically/emotionally respond.

  This process is classical conditioning.

  - Unconditioned Stimulus - stimulus that we don't learn (eg person getting
    ripped apart)
  - Unconditioned Response - response to stimulus that we don't need to learn.
  - Neutral stimulus - something we don't have a learned/unconditioned response
    for.
  - conditioned stimulus - something we have learned a response for.
  - conditioned response - response we have learned.

  Pavlov's Dog!
  - meat: UCS
  - bell: neutral stimulus
  - after conditioning, the bell was a conditioned stimulus

  Sensory memory.

  Iconic storage
  - visual
  - duration of .5 - 2 seconds.
  - flip-o-rama

  Echoic storage
  - auditory
  - duration of 3-4 seconds

  Information Processing Model
  - Stimuli first go to sensory registers.  If we do nothing with it, the
    information is lost.
  - If we decide to do something with it, it goes into our short-term memory
    (STM).
    - From STM, if you continue to rehearse it, you can maintain it in short
      term memory.  *maintenance rehearsal*
  - Long Term Memory (LTM)
    - You can retrieve items from LTM into STM

  Short Term Memory (STM)
  - Holds the information to which we are consciously attending.
  - Short term memory task

  XNBCPHDSATCBSX

  Chunking
  - group information into large chunks.  For example, in the above string of
    letters:
  - X NBC PHD SAT CBS X
  - Only 5 pieces of information
  - Facilitates moving into LTM by relating to information you already know.

  Short-term memory and long-term memory are not the same as recent and remote.

  Organizing information in Long-Term Memory
  - Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) Model
    - Represent information/details as nodes in a graph.
  - Spreading activation theory.

  Types of long-term memory
  - Explicit (conscious)
    - Processed in hippocampus
    - Facts - general knowledge (semantic)
    - Personal experience (episodic)
    - "Declarative"
  - Implicit (unconscious)
    - Processed in cerebellum
    - Skills - motor and cognitive.
    - Condition effects.
    - Procedural.

  Loss of info from LTM
  - Decay theory - "it just fades"
  - Interference theory - "something is blocking you from being able to recall."
    - "It's on the tip of my tongue!"
  - Motivated forgetting - "we'll get to this later"

  We had a quiz yo.

* 2015-02-29 Monday

  Happy leap day!

  Yesterday:
  - Listen to Tumblin' Dice (Rolling Stones) and try to write down lyrics.
  - Then, listen again with the lyrics on the screen.
  - You can actually understand the words you're hearing when you can also see
    them on the screen.
  - This is due to top-down processing, where your brain uses information you
    already know in processing sensory inputs.

  Top-Down Processing vs Bottom-Up Processing

  - FINEK -> KNIFE
  - OPONS -> SPOON
  - KROF -> FORK
  - UPC -> CUP
  - ECUSAR -> SAUCER
  - LTEPA -> PLATE

  Once you figure out the theme, the anagrams become much easier to solve.

  Problem Solving Strategies
  - Algorithms (systematic approach).
  - Heuristics (cognitive shortcuts)

  Heuristic approaches reduce the number of candidates you consider, leading you
  to be less "open-minded".

  Impediments to problem-solving
  - mental sets
  - irrelevant information
  - functional fixedness
  - confirmation bias

  Confirmation Bias, Yay!

  Spring Break is over :((((

  *Intelligence*

  It's complicated to define intelligence.  Theorists have apparently argued
  about it for a long time.  Over time, people have recognized that it is
  multi-faceted.  And apparently these are some of the facets:
  - Knowledge: we tend to think that people who know a lot are smart.  We
    recognize that how much you know isn't the only part of intelligence, but
    frequently knowledge corresponds with interest and intellectual discipline
    that we respect as parts of Intelligence as well.
  - Culture: Different cultures respect different mental capabilities.
  - Problem Solving
  - Social Intuitions & Skills: good at communicating with people in a way that
    can get them to agree with their arguments.

  Psychometric Approach
  - Statistical techniques \to intellectual skills and abilities
  - IQ = (Mental Age / Chronological Age) \times 100
  - People execute tasks and get ranked on their mental age (based on statistics
    of other people's performances).  This is used to get their IQ
  - Wechsler Intelligence Scales: Full Scale IQ \to Verbal IQ, Performance IQ
  - So, lots of statistics on people's performance on tests.

  Understanding Intelligence
  - Psychometric Approach
  - Information-Processing Approach
  - Multiple Intelligences

  Information Processing Approach
  - Knowledge Base
  - Speed of Processing
  - Acquisition & Application

  Multiple Intelligences Approach
  - "Intelligence is a function of multiple systems."
    - Kind of like how there are different types of IQ scores that contribute to
      the full-scale IQ.
  - The idea is that these different "intelligences" or skills frequently go
    together; that is, somebody who has high verbal skills will tend to score
    higher in other areas as well.
  - However, the MI approach also seems to suggest (unlike Psychometric
    Approach) that these intelligence areas also stand on their own, and aren't
    necessarily part of a larger general intelligence score.

  Nature vs Nurture Controversy
  - Heritability of IQ
