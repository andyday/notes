  Intro: stand up, pat your head, jump up and down.  Why did we do that?
  Because the person we thought was the professor told us to.  A bunch of social
  and cognitive "stuff" goes into that.

  Optical illusion pictures - the ones you can see multiple ways.  Your mind
  takes information, organizes, combines, and interprets things in different
  ways.  The same thing happens when you go to movies and discuss them with
  friends.  Or when you relate an experience to someone else.

  Apparently we need iClickers, which sound like another racket.  You can create
  a polling website that you can log into with Case ID's very simply and easily,
  even with Google Docs.  But instead they require students to purchase $40
  remotes!

  Anyway, we did a bunch of iClicker questions.  They were all false.  Then we
  had half of the class look at common sayings and say how many they agree with.
  Then the other half looked at common sayings that mean the opposite, and do
  the same.  The illustration was that we think Psychology is common sense, but
  things we believe to be common sense are frequently wrong.

  Empiricism: the belief that accurate knowledge of the world requires
  observation of it.

  So do research.

  The article we were supposed to read made conclusions on 12 weeks of data from
  a full year study.  So that's bad.

  Elements of the Scientific Process (according to PSCL 101):
  - Theory - a logically consistent model that is supported by data
  - Hypothesis - a proposed explanation for something
  - Variables

  Still doing "scientific method" stuff.
  - Independent Variable - factor assumed to influence
  - Dependent Variable - factor expected to change as a result of the
    independent variable

  Need to "operationally define" what I mean by the variables.  Define in terms
  of what you're going to do in your experiment.

  - Operational definitions: statements that describe the exact operation or
    method used to define each variable

  Descriptive Research:
  - Case studies
  - Naturalistic observation
  - Survey research

  Correlational Research: determines the degree to which variables are related
  - Correlation coefficient (r) ranges from -1 to 1.

  Wait.  Correlation /isn't/ causation??  My world is *shattered.*

  We're going to talk about the brain and the things that go on in it.

  - Cerebral cortex - outer portion of the brain, roughly 80%.  Contains
    millions of nerves (neurons)
  - Neuron - basic cell that specializes in electrically transmitting
    information through the brain
    - Cell body - makes new components, etc.
    - Dendrite - tendrils coming off the cell body, they receive information
      from other cells.
    - Axon - a *longer* branch from the cell body, which transmits information
      to other cells.
    - Myelin Sheath - helps speed up/insulate the transmission of impulses
    - At the end of the axon (the terminal buttons), you find Synapses
    - When a signal "fires" through the axon, some chemicals are released which
      cross the synapse and start the impulse in the next neuron
  - Neural Communication
    - Within the neuron, transmission is electrical
    - Between the neurons, transmission is chemical
  - Neurotransmitters
    - Serotonin - regulates mood and depression, appetite, sleep, sensory stuff
      - People who suffer from depressions frequently report disruptions in
        appetite and sleep
    - Acetylcholine - involved in voluntary movement, learning, sleep
      - Too much can be associated with depression
      - Too little in the hippocampus (?) can be associated with dimensia
    - Dopamine - makes you feel "good" - part of the "reward system".  Also
      involved with motor control.
    - Endorphins - part of pain management system
      - painkillers are similar in structure to endorphins
  - Three types of neurons:
    - Sensory neurons
    - Motor neurons
      - mirror: "feel" what other people are feeling, empathy, etc.
    - Interneurons
  - Nervous System
    - Central Nervous System (CNS) = nerves within the brain and spinal cord
    - Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) = nerves outside brain and spinal cord
      - Somatic or Voluntary (skeletal muscles)
      - Autonomic (smooth and cardiac muscles and glands)
        - Parasympathetic branch (homeostasis, daily maintenance)
        - Sympathetic branch (alert system)
  - Major areas of the brain
    - forebrain
      - frontal lobe - planning, organizing, "executive functions", emotions,
        social judgements, etc
      - temporal lobe -
      - parietal lobe - sensory & perceptual info,
      - occipital lobe -
    - midbrain
      - helps respond to visual/audio stimuli with muscle movements
      - some memory
    - hindbrain - most primitive, but essential part of the brain
      - regulates air, blood, consciousness, etc.
  - We have those "lobes" on both sides of the brain, but we also have two
    "hemispheres"
    - each side is responsible for the opposite side's motion.
    - Left Hemisphere: language & speech, motor functions of the right hand &
      leg, sensory functions of the right hand & leg;
      - infants will do more thumb sucking when language is heard in their right
        ear (which is sent to the left hemisphere)
    - Right Hemisphere: spatial & non-verbal, (plus motor/sensory functions of
      left side).
      - Aprosodia - condition where you are unable to detect or produce
        intonation and tones in people's voices.
        - damaged right frontal lobe = you can't "produce" variation
        - damaged right temporal lobe = you can't interpret/receive this
          variation.
    - Corpus callosum - a band of fibers through which information can be
      transferred between hemispheres
