<b>Web Timeouts and Their Implications</b>
</p>

<p>
Types of (D)Dos
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Application attacks
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>frequently HTTP</li>
<li>grab-and-hold</li>
</ul></li>
<li>TCP SYN</li>
<li>Reflection attacks
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ICMP, TCP SYN, DNS, NTP</li>
<li>Amplification</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Recent Trends
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Purpose of this class: to dispel the false sense of security that "we have
the security measures, we are fine."</li>
<li>Security is not a solved problem, it's an ongoing battle</li>
<li>Further, <i>we are not winning</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As federal spending on "cyber defense" increases linearly, the amount of
security incidents against federal agencies increases super-linearly.</li>
<li>Corporate attacks are very common, and cost huge amounts of money.</li>
<li>Attacks on national infrastructure are becoming much more common.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>With impending integration of our everyday lives on the Internet ("Internet
of Things"), this could be a "disaster in the making".</li>
<li>Top 85% of attacks
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>HTTP Flood, TCP Flood, and DNS Flood</li>
<li>DNS flood is the top attack (42% of all attacks)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Claim and Hold DoS Attacks
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The idea
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Claim a resource on the server, and hold onto it for a long time.</li>
<li>Because the request is well formed, it is difficult to filter out.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Examples
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Slowlory: attacks HTTP servers, sending requests one byte at a time.</li>
<li>Slowdroid: Attacks any TCP server by sending an endless sequence of spaces</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Web server example:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Opportunities:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Send a SYN, wait for completed handshake.</li>
<li>After handshake is completed, start transmitting request s-l-o-w-l-y</li>
<li>After request is completed, consume the response s-l-o-w-l-y (using TCP
small receive window, and small amounts of acknowledgements).</li>
<li>After response is completed, hold onto the the connection as long as
possible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Server has to combat these attacks with timeouts:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Application timeout: time from completing handshake to receiving first
byte of request</li>
<li>Request timeout: time from receiving first to last byte of request</li>
<li>Response timeout: time for the client to consume the entire response</li>
<li>TCP timeout: time the server holds onto the connection without receiving
ACKs.</li>
<li>Keep-Alive timeout: time the server will keep a connection alive after
the response is completed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
TCP Timeout
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Time server allows for client to ACK a data packet.</li>
<li>Send a HTTP request, disappear, and measure one of the following
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Time of last retransmission (this is a lower bound on the timeout, 61% of
servers).
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The majority of these servers persist over 100 seconds!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Or FIN (9% of servers).
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The majority of these persist under 10 seconds, but some go longer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Or RST (30% of servers).
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The majority of these servers persist over 100 seconds as well!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>To measure the effect of reducing the TCP timeout, two web servers were
deployed:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One which used the regular Linux TCP timeout: 15 retransmissions,
exponential backoff, 13-30 minutes total!</li>
<li>One which used 3 retransmissions, ~600 ms (each?).</li>
<li>Dropped connections due to timeouts increased by 0.16%.  So barely at all.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Application Timeout
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Time the server allows from completing the connection handshake until
receiving the first byte of the HTTP request.</li>
<li>Method: Open a TCP connection, don't send a request, and observe how long we
can keep it open.</li>
<li>About 36% of sites don't terminate after 20 minutes of waiting.  This may be
due to the TCP DEFER ACCEPT option of TCP stacks, which allows the server to
defer "accepting" the TCP connection until the first byte of the request
comes in.</li>
<li>Many sites have timeouts over 100s.</li>
<li>99% of requests happen within a second of the handshake completion.  This is
a huge disconnect from the allowed timeouts.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Request Timeout
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Time from receiving first byte of the HTTP request to receiving the last
byte of the request.</li>
<li>Method: open connection, send 1000-bytes HTTP GET request, one byte per
segmet, one segment per second.  Observe if (or when) the connection is
terminated.</li>
<li>Majority of sites didn't close connection.</li>
<li>85% of requests fit within 1 packet.</li>
<li>99.9% of requests take less than 1 second to be transmitted.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Response Timeout
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Time for client to consume entire response (bytes/second)</li>
<li>Method: open a connection, send a request, consume the response at 100
bytes/sec.  Observe if server terminates the question.</li>
<li>Only 24% of sites impose a limit on response rate.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This corresponds to roughly the fraction of IIS servers in the population,
which is the only web server known to impose a response rate limit.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Almost 99% of responses are consumed at a rate of at least 10 Kbps.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Keep-Alive
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is much better addressed, since many people are aware of this timeout
and restrict it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Last time - firewall.  Distinguishing feature: interposed in your path to the
network.
</p>

<p>
Today: Intrusion Detection System.  These inspect packets, do "deep packet
inspection", and try to correlate them together to identify attacks and
intrusion attempts.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>May have multiple IDS's.  For instance, you may set up a DMZ for publicly
accessible servers, and have a IDS for them.  Then, in the private network,
another IDS.  Finally, you may put further IDS's closer to valuable assets
in order to improve your chances of detection.</li>
<li>Taxonomy of IDS's:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Signature based vs anomaly detection
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Signature based: has classifiers for several different attack types.  If
incoming traffic is classified as an attack, raise an alarm.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>These can be more accurate, because they can describe specific attacks
that may not look anomalous.</li>
<li>However, they cannot detect new attacks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Anomaly detection: creates statistical models for "normal" traffic.
Then raises an alarm when traffic "sticks out" from the normal model.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Can detect new attacks</li>
<li>So many false positives</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Network IDS vs Host IDS
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>NIDS: sniff packets on a whole network.  Requires lots of computing
power.  But, this means that they are monitoring an entire network
segment.</li>
<li>HIDES: Analyzes only at the host-level.  Can use OS-level events (even
TCP state tracking).  Usually deployed on high-value targets.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Evasion
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Searching for text or patterns within TCP connections is hard.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Can't look just for text in a packet (could be spread across multiple)</li>
<li>Can't look just for text in sequential packets (could be reordered)</li>
<li>Could we reassemble the byte stream?  Tricky&#x2026;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Defining patterns to search for is hard
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For directory names, could substitute a ton of variations on valid path
names.</li>
<li>Or could use character escapes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Packet fragmentation!</li>
<li>As an attacker, any of these variations can be combined.</li>
<li>Additionally, IDS's fail "open", such that the network traffic continues to
flow if an IDS is overwhelmed.  So one common attack is to disable the IDS
by volume or some other way, and then carry on your actual attack without
detection.</li>
<li>TTL Exploit:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An attacker may send multiple TCP segments with the same sequence
number, but different payloads, and different TTL fields.</li>
<li>The ones with lower TTL fields will be dropped, so the end host will
only see their intended text.</li>
<li>But IDS will see all the different segments, and have trouble piecing
together the true message.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fragmentation Attack:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Overlap:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Send IP fragment F1 and F2, where F2 overlaps the end of F1.</li>
<li>This is "prohibited" - it should never happen.</li>
<li>But, OS's deal with it in different ways.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Some use the data from F1</li>
<li>Some use the data from F2</li>
<li>Some use the first packet to arrive.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>IDS can't guess behavior of every end system</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reassembly:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Network stacks need to hold onto packets that are fragmented, so that
when they receive the next one, they can piece them together.</li>
<li>They have a timeout on their buffers, so that they don't hold them
indefinitely.</li>
<li>If the end host has a longer timer than the IDS:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Send F1, wait for the IDS to timeout, then send F2</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If the IDS has a longer timer than the end-host:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Prepare fragments F1, F2, F2', such that F1F2 is an attack, but
F1F2' looks ok.</li>
<li>Send F1</li>
<li>Wait for end-host to timeout.</li>
<li>Send F2'</li>
<li>&#x2026; (slides)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Port Scan Evasion:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If a computer (Patsy) has deterministic IP IDs, an attacker can send a ping
stream to view the IP ID state.  Then, they can send TCP SYN's to a victim,
spoofed as the Patsy.</li>
<li>If the Victim's port is open, they will SYN ACK to the Patsy, and the PATSY
will RESET back, which uses in IP ID.  The attacker can observe this and
have good evidence that the port is open.</li>
</ul>

<p>
IDS Guidelines
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Preventing TTL attacks:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Deploy as close to destination hosts as possible</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Preventing fragmentation attacks:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Drop fragmented packets at entry</li>
<li>Not a great solution!  What about tunneling?  Fragmentation regularly
happens when tunneling traffic.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bifurcation attacks
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Try to analyze all possibilities.</li>
<li>Also not a good solution.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Traffic Normalizer
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sit in the path of traffic, and resolves ambiguities.</li>
<li>For fragments, it will use the shortest reassembly timer, and drop the next
packet fragments after the timeout so nobody gets them (either IDS or end
host)</li>
<li>Always rewrite TTL to fixed value.</li>
<li>Always resolve fragment ambiguities in a particular way.</li>
<li>Limitations
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Can't know application behavior</li>
<li>EG: TCP urgent pointer
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Some system calls may not return "urgent" data without a special
command.</li>
<li>So, one way you might read "robot", another way may read "root".</li>
<li>The IDS/normalizer can't know how the socket is being used, so it can't
tell about these things.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
On the bright side, traffic normalizer fails closed, which is good for
preventing attacks, but bad if the attacker wants to cut off internet access.
</p>

<p>
Summary:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>NIDS performs stateful deep packet inspection</li>
<li>Difficult - must obtain same view of traffic as the destination.</li>
<li>When IDS view diverges from hosts, problems happen</li>
<li>Normalizers can help keep these views synchronized</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="orgheadline8"><span class="section-number-3">6.1</span> DNSSEC</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-1">
<p>
<b>Goals</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Origin Authentication: make sure that a response really came from the
authoritative "zone"</li>
<li>Integrity: make sure that the response hasn't been changed</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Main Ideas</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Each zone gets a public/private key.</li>
<li>Public key goes into a DNSKEY record.</li>
<li>Private key is used to sign records, and since records are typically
static, ideally the private key will be kept offline.</li>
<li>Signature is stored in RRSIG record.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Authenticity of DNSKEY</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Get your key signed by your parent's ADNS.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When you get authority for your zone, you get your key signed.</li>
<li>Your parent ADNS keeps NS record for your ADNS.</li>
<li>They also keep a DS (Delegation Signature) record to</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Somewhat similar to a CA hierarchy.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Non-Existing Name</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When you query for a non-existing name, you return a NXDOMAIN record.</li>
<li>How to trust that, when a man in the middle could simply capture a record
signed once and feed it back to queries for each query?</li>
<li>You would have to sign each NXDOMAIN query individually, which would
require an online private key.</li>
<li>Instead, we use an NSEC record, which specifies a "bracket" between
subdomains (e.g. "a.case.edu" through "d.case.edu"), and says that there
are no valid domains in between them.</li>
<li>All signatures expire (so that this will become invalid after a while).</li>
<li>So, an invalid query would return NXDOMAIN, plus the correct bracket around
the invalid domain.</li>
<li>Sadly, this introduces the problem that now you can easily enumerate all
DNS names in a zone.</li>
<li>Instead, we can hash the valid names, and order those.  We use those
brackets instead!  NSEC3 records!</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Chain of Trust</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We now have two different trust hierarchies: DNSSEC, and X.509 (that is,
PKI, or the SSL certificate hierarchy).  (There is actually a third
hierarchy for router advertisements, based on the hierarchy of ISP's, etc).</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Problems</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Although DNSSEC solves authentication and integrity, it makes DNS
reflection attacks worse.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is because it makes responses even bigger, providing a bigger
amplification for reflection attacks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Responses are too big for UDP.</li>
<li>As a result, deployment is very low.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This may change if we are able to prevent forged source IP addresses.</li>
<li>Or, if a high-profile DNS poisoning attack occurs (e.g. Google).</li>

Correction of TLS handshake:

<li>However, this would allow a hijacking!</li>
<li>Instead, each side generates some random bits, and they are exchanged in
the first two exchanges.  Then, the client sends some bits to the server
encrypted with the server's public key.</li>

<h3 id="orgheadline11"><span class="section-number-3">7.1</span> Encryption: Message Authentication Problem</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-1">
<p>
As we saw last time, if I want to send an encrypted message to Misha, I can
probably easily find a private key associated with him.  However, I have no
way of being certain that the private key I find belongs to him.  Someone
could have maliciously crafted that key so that they could intercept my
encrypted messages to him.
</p>

<p>
One solution to this is to enlist a third-party to help.  If we all trust
this third party, then I can send my public key to them, have them sign it
(encrypt the hash with their private key), and then include that signature
with my key when I send it to Misha.  Misha could verify the signature, and
if he trusts the third party, he can be certain that the certificate belongs
to me.
</p>

<p>
This third party is called a Root Certificate Authority.  These third parties
can, as they sign a public key, delegate the CA power to other entities,
giving them the power to sign keys for themselves.  This creates a trust
hierarchy.  We also have revocation lists for certificates that should no
longer be trusted.

<h3 id="orgheadline12"><span class="section-number-3">7.2</span> HTTPS</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-2">
<p>
HTTP:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No privacy</li>
<li>No authentication</li>
<li>No message integrity</li>
<li>Vulnerable to hijacking</li>
</ul>

<p>
Need a way to improve this situation.  Enter HTTPS!  HTTPS = HTTP over
TLS. HTTPS Connection startup:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Client &rarr; Server: opens connection with Server</li>
<li>Server &rarr; Client: responds with signed certificate and session ID</li>
<li>Client &rarr; Server: sends some bits (encrypted with Server's public key), also
sends their public key</li>
<li>Server &rarr; Client: adds their own bits, generates a random master key, and
sends that back, encrypted with client public key</li>
<li>Client &rarr; Server: encrypts with the master key a hash of all messages sent
previously, guaranteeing they were the one the server was talking to all
along.</li>
</ul>

<p>
HTTP Benefits;
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Authentication - somewhat.  If we can trust our third parties in the
certificate authority hierarchy, we can generally trust for authentication.</li>
<li>Privacy - encrypted communication means people can't listen in after the
initial negotiation</li>

<p>
Negative Response Rewriting
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When you do a DNS query with your local DNS resolver (typically operated by
an ISP), and the result is an error (failure), the resolver may rewrite the
error message with their own message.</li>
<li>ISP responds with a record pointing to a "buy this domain?" page or a
"search" page for you.  How helpful! :(</li>
<li>My ISP (time warner cable) does this &gt;:(</li>
</ul>

<p>
Search Engine Hijacking
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ISP redirects www.google.com to their own servers, which communicate with
google for searches, but modify the results, advertise, etc.</li>
<li>Not widespread anymore, because ISPs were caught doing it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Kaminsky Attack
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What if DNS resolver is honest?  Well, it can still be subverted.</li>
<li>An attacker can send queries to DNS servers for random subdomains of
existing domains.</li>
<li>Then, it can spoof the Authoritative DNS server of that domain, and send
back a response that includes a NS record assigning the new nameserver to
be the attacker's.</li>
<li>If the resolver accepts the fake NS record, its cache is polluted, and
everyone who uses that resolver gets records resolved by a fake ADNS
server.</li>
<li>Kaminsky showed that, even with 16-bit transaction identifiers, it is only
a matter of minutes before the attacker can correctly guess the txid and
poison a cache.  Which is not a bad cost at all if you can poison a cache
for a long time.</li>
<li>However, if DNS resolver uses ephemeral ports for receiving the response,
that adds 16 bits more entropy, which makes the attach pretty much
impossible.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Preplay attack
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>DNS resolvers on home routers can be pretty dumb.</li>
<li>Some don't check for the IP address of the RDNS, or the transaction ID, or
the destination port!</li>
<li>So, the attacker can simply send a request and then an answer, no guessing
required, and poison that household's DNS cache.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can also use the WiFi DNS forwarders to conduct Kaminsky attacks on ISP
DNS servers that don't accept external queries.  So that's a downer.  The
number of open forwarders has been declining (was 30 million, now is 17
million), but still isn't great.

<p>
I'm sure topics will be available online, and we'll get to them soon enough.

Your summaries must follow these sections exactly.  Some may be absent, but
everything must have a section.  Due before class so we can discuss (submitted
online via email in plain text).  Note that this is mostly a summary!  Your
opinions on the paper only belong in the small "My Impressions" section.
</p>

<p>
Some questions to ask about the paper, to identify flaws.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Can someone else replicate the results using the paper?</li>
<li>Are the assumptions clear enough?  (Careful, we're not assessing, just
learning).  Do the assumptions potentially bias the paper?</li>
<li>Does the research eliminate alternative explanations of results?</li>
<li>Do conclusions follow logically from evidence.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Dos and don'ts in paper summaries:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Not a review.</li>
<li>Inappropriate characterizations are "comprehensive", or "insufficient
references".</li>
<li>This is what you need to remember 10 years from now.</li>
<li>Value conciseness.</li>
<li>Value specificity: focus on "how", not "what"</li>

<p>
Discussion guidelines:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Lecture for about 30-40 minutes.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Allocate 2 minutes per slide.  You expect they will be quicker, but
usually your explanations.</li>

<li>With asymmetric encryption, the key exchange is very similar.  We make one

<p>
Authentication (signing) using symmetric keys.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Append the key to the message.</li>
<li>Hash that to get a "message authentication code", and append that to your
original message, and send it.</li>
<li>Recipient can duplicate your actions and verify the message.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Message Authentication using asymmetric keys
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Hash the message, and encrypt it with your private key.  Include that as
the signature.</li>
<li>Recipient can decrypt your signature using the public key, hash the
message, and compare the two hashes.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Interesting side note: the signature will necessarily be the same size as
the asymmetric key, which is inconvenient for large keys.
</p>

<p>
Sadly, with asymmetric keys, it's difficult to be certain that a key belongs
to somebody (and isn't being spoofed).  So you need to get keys certified by
a trusted third party.
