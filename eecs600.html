<b>Defense for DNS</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Close resolvers to outside queries!
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>But, WiFi routers frequently offer a "trap door" to indirectly query
resolvers even when they're closed.</li>
<li>Some need to be open (Google public DNS)</li>

<h3 id="orgheadline2"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> DNSSEC</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
<b>Goals</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Origin Authentication: make sure that a response really came from the
authoritative "zone"</li>
<li>Integrity: make sure that the response hasn't been changed</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Main Ideas</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Each zone gets a public/private key.</li>
<li>Public key goes into a DNSKEY record.</li>
<li>Private key is used to sign records, and since records are typically
static, ideally the private key will be kept offline.</li>
<li>Signature is stored in RRSIG record.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Authenticity of DNSKEY</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Get your key signed by your parent's ADNS.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When you get authority for your zone, you get your key signed.</li>
<li>Your parent ADNS keeps NS record for your ADNS.</li>
<li>They also keep a DS (Delegation Signature) record to</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Somewhat similar to a CA hierarchy.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Non-Existing Name</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When you query for a non-existing name, you return a NXDOMAIN record.</li>
<li>How to trust that, when a man in the middle could simply capture a record
signed once and feed it back to queries for each query?</li>
<li>You would have to sign each NXDOMAIN query individually, which would
require an online private key.</li>
<li>Instead, we use an NSEC record, which specifies a "bracket" between
subdomains (e.g. "a.case.edu" through "d.case.edu"), and says that there
are no valid domains in between them.</li>
<li>All signatures expire (so that this will become invalid after a while).</li>
<li>So, an invalid query would return NXDOMAIN, plus the correct bracket around
the invalid domain.</li>
<li>Sadly, this introduces the problem that now you can easily enumerate all
DNS names in a zone.</li>
<li>Instead, we can hash the valid names, and order those.  We use those
brackets instead!  NSEC3 records!</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Chain of Trust</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We now have two different trust hierarchies: DNSSEC, and X.509 (that is,
PKI, or the SSL certificate hierarchy).  (There is actually a third
hierarchy for router advertisements, based on the hierarchy of ISP's, etc).</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Problems</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Although DNSSEC solves authentication and integrity, it makes DNS
reflection attacks worse.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is because it makes responses even bigger, providing a bigger
amplification for reflection attacks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Responses are too big for UDP.</li>
<li>As a result, deployment is very low.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This may change if we are able to prevent forged source IP addresses.</li>
<li>Or, if a high-profile DNS poisoning attack occurs (e.g. Google).</li>
</ul></li>

Correction of TLS handshake:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The 5th exchange of the TLS handshake presented last time indicated that
the server sends back a master key encrypted with the client's public key.</li>
<li>However, this would allow a hijacking!</li>
<li>Instead, each side generates some random bits, and they are exchanged in
the first two exchanges.  Then, the client sends some bits to the server
encrypted with the server's public key.</li>
<li>Both sides compute the master key from those bits.</li>

<h3 id="orgheadline5"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> Encryption: Message Authentication Problem</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
As we saw last time, if I want to send an encrypted message to Misha, I can
probably easily find a private key associated with him.  However, I have no
way of being certain that the private key I find belongs to him.  Someone
could have maliciously crafted that key so that they could intercept my
encrypted messages to him.
</p>

<p>
One solution to this is to enlist a third-party to help.  If we all trust
this third party, then I can send my public key to them, have them sign it
(encrypt the hash with their private key), and then include that signature
with my key when I send it to Misha.  Misha could verify the signature, and
if he trusts the third party, he can be certain that the certificate belongs
to me.
</p>

<p>
This third party is called a Root Certificate Authority.  These third parties
can, as they sign a public key, delegate the CA power to other entities,
giving them the power to sign keys for themselves.  This creates a trust
hierarchy.  We also have revocation lists for certificates that should no
longer be trusted.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline6"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> HTTPS</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
HTTP:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No privacy</li>
<li>No authentication</li>
<li>No message integrity</li>
<li>Vulnerable to hijacking</li>
</ul>

<p>
Need a way to improve this situation.  Enter HTTPS!  HTTPS = HTTP over
TLS. HTTPS Connection startup:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Client &rarr; Server: opens connection with Server</li>
<li>Server &rarr; Client: responds with signed certificate and session ID</li>
<li>Client &rarr; Server: sends some bits (encrypted with Server's public key), also
sends their public key</li>
<li>Server &rarr; Client: adds their own bits, generates a random master key, and
sends that back, encrypted with client public key</li>
<li>Client &rarr; Server: encrypts with the master key a hash of all messages sent
previously, guaranteeing they were the one the server was talking to all
along.</li>
</ul>

<p>
HTTP Benefits;
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Authentication - somewhat.  If we can trust our third parties in the
certificate authority hierarchy, we can generally trust for authentication.</li>
<li>Privacy - encrypted communication means people can't listen in after the
initial negotiation</li>

<h3 id="orgheadline7"><span class="section-number-3">3.3</span> DNS</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
Negative Response Rewriting
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When you do a DNS query with your local DNS resolver (typically operated by
an ISP), and the result is an error (failure), the resolver may rewrite the
error message with their own message.</li>
<li>ISP responds with a record pointing to a "buy this domain?" page or a
"search" page for you.  How helpful! :(</li>
<li>My ISP (time warner cable) does this &gt;:(</li>
</ul>

<p>
Search Engine Hijacking
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ISP redirects www.google.com to their own servers, which communicate with
google for searches, but modify the results, advertise, etc.</li>
<li>Not widespread anymore, because ISPs were caught doing it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Kaminsky Attack
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What if DNS resolver is honest?  Well, it can still be subverted.</li>
<li>An attacker can send queries to DNS servers for random subdomains of
existing domains.</li>
<li>Then, it can spoof the Authoritative DNS server of that domain, and send
back a response that includes a NS record assigning the new nameserver to
be the attacker's.</li>
<li>If the resolver accepts the fake NS record, its cache is polluted, and
everyone who uses that resolver gets records resolved by a fake ADNS
server.</li>
<li>Kaminsky showed that, even with 16-bit transaction identifiers, it is only
a matter of minutes before the attacker can correctly guess the txid and
poison a cache.  Which is not a bad cost at all if you can poison a cache
for a long time.</li>
<li>However, if DNS resolver uses ephemeral ports for receiving the response,
that adds 16 bits more entropy, which makes the attach pretty much
impossible.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Preplay attack
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>DNS resolvers on home routers can be pretty dumb.</li>
<li>Some don't check for the IP address of the RDNS, or the transaction ID, or
the destination port!</li>
<li>So, the attacker can simply send a request and then an answer, no guessing
required, and poison that household's DNS cache.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can also use the WiFi DNS forwarders to conduct Kaminsky attacks on ISP
DNS servers that don't accept external queries.  So that's a downer.  The
number of open forwarders has been declining (was 30 million, now is 17
million), but still isn't great.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
Goals:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Many subfields of networking are fleeting, but a few like Security and
Measurements are long-term.  So the topic of Security is a prudent one to
study.</li>
<li>We will prepare for research in this area by reading papers, presenting
them, and undertaking a research project.</li>
<li>This is not computer security:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We will not study buffer overflows, Sql injection, etc.  Nothing that
allows someone to take over a computer.</li>
<li>Instead, we will cover attacks that don't require compromising the
computer, just the network.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm sure topics will be available online, and we'll get to them soon enough.
</p>

<p>
Tasks:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Read papers, write summaries (which "isn't as easy as you think").</li>
<li>Present a paper and lead the discussion on it.</li>
<li>Final exam = project + presentation</li>
</ul>

<p>
Paper Summaries:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Topic
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>1-2 sentence summary of the topic.</li>
<li>Is it a "mechanisms" or "characterizations" paper?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mechanisms: proposes some new technique</li>
<li>Characterizations: measures some property of the internet</li>
<li>Sometimes it's both</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Key Ideas/Observations
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>1-2 most important ideas</li>
<li>For mechanisms, the ideas behind the mechanisms</li>
<li>For characterizations, the key observations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Flaws (1 or 2)</li>
<li>Open Questions (1 or 2)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Where can you take the research from here?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>My Impressions
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>1-2 sentences with your impression (is it good or not, why?)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Your summaries must follow these sections exactly.  Some may be absent, but
everything must have a section.  Due before class so we can discuss (submitted
online via email in plain text).  Note that this is mostly a summary!  Your
opinions on the paper only belong in the small "My Impressions" section.
</p>

<p>
Some questions to ask about the paper, to identify flaws.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Can someone else replicate the results using the paper?</li>
<li>Are the assumptions clear enough?  (Careful, we're not assessing, just
learning).  Do the assumptions potentially bias the paper?</li>
<li>Does the research eliminate alternative explanations of results?</li>
<li>Do conclusions follow logically from evidence.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Dos and don'ts in paper summaries:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Not a review.</li>
<li>Inappropriate characterizations are "comprehensive", or "insufficient
references".</li>
<li>This is what you need to remember 10 years from now.</li>
<li>Value conciseness.</li>
<li>Value specificity: focus on "how", not "what"</li>
</ul>

<p>
Discussion guidelines:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Lecture for about 30-40 minutes.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Allocate 2 minutes per slide.  You expect they will be quicker, but
usually your explanations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Discussion for 30-40 minutes</li>
<li>Wrap up (5 mins)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Grading:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>20% paper presentation.</li>
<li>40% paper summaries</li>
<li>10% class participation (attendance + discussions)</li>
<li>30% final</li>
</ul>

<p>
This content will be a brief overview of the basics.  Just enough for our
subsequent discussions on security.
</p>

<p>
Two varieties of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric

<h4 id="orgheadline10"><span class="section-number-4">4.2.1</span> Symmetric encryption:</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-2-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Two parties share a secret.</li>
<li>Encryption/decryption algorithms scramble/unscramble plaintext using the
key.</li>
<li>Typically very fast, and the key is very small.</li>
<li>However, it is very difficult to distribute keys securely.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Diffie-Hellman's protocol:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Alice and Bob agree to use a prime number p and a base g (which have some
properties we won't discuss).</li>
<li>Alice chooses secret integer a, then sends Bob \(A = g^a \mod p\).  It
turns out that it's very difficult to guess a from A.</li>
<li>Bob chooses secret integer b, then sends Alice \(B = g^b \mod p\).</li>
<li>Alice computes \(s = B^a \mod p = g^{ba} \mod p\)</li>
<li>Bob computes \(s = A^b \mod p = g^{ab} \mod p\).</li>
<li>Alice and Bob now share the secret \(s\).</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="orgheadline11"><span class="section-number-4">4.2.2</span> Asymmetric encryption</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-2-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Pair of keys, (S,P).  You encrypt with one and decrypt with the other.</li>
<li>With asymmetric encryption, the key exchange is very similar.  We make one
of our keys public, and we simply encrypt messages to others using their
public keys.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Two types of asymmetric key types:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>RSA
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Large (1-4 kbits)</li>
<li>Efficient</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Elliptic curve
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Small (about 160 bits)</li>
<li>Expensive</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline12" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgheadline12"><span class="section-number-4">4.2.3</span> Uses of Encryption</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-2-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Message Encryption - make it so that only owners of a key can read it.</li>
<li>Message Signature
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Message may be distributed in the clear.</li>
<li>Only the key owner could have signed it.</li>
<li>Verifies authenticity and that the message has not been modified.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Authentication (signing) using symmetric keys.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Append the key to the message.</li>
<li>Hash that to get a "message authentication code", and append that to your
original message, and send it.</li>
<li>Recipient can duplicate your actions and verify the message.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Message Authentication using asymmetric keys
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Hash the message, and encrypt it with your private key.  Include that as
the signature.</li>
<li>Recipient can decrypt your signature using the public key, hash the
message, and compare the two hashes.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Interesting side note: the signature will necessarily be the same size as
the asymmetric key, which is inconvenient for large keys.
</p>

<p>
Sadly, with asymmetric keys, it's difficult to be certain that a key belongs
to somebody (and isn't being spoofed).  So you need to get keys certified by
a trusted third party.
