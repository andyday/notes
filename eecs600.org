** Logistics

  Goals:
  - Many subfields of networking are fleeting, but a few like Security and
    Measurements are long-term.  So the topic of Security is a prudent one to
    study.
  - We will prepare for research in this area by reading papers, presenting
    them, and undertaking a research project.
  - This is not computer security:
    - We will not study buffer overflows, Sql injection, etc.  Nothing that
      allows someone to take over a computer.
    - Instead, we will cover attacks that don't require compromising the
      computer, just the network.

  I'm sure topics will be available online, and we'll get to them soon enough.

  Tasks:
  - Read papers, write summaries (which "isn't as easy as you think").
  - Present a paper and lead the discussion on it.
  - Final exam = project + presentation

  Paper Summaries:
  - Topic
    - 1-2 sentence summary of the topic.
    - Is it a "mechanisms" or "characterizations" paper?
      - Mechanisms: proposes some new technique
      - Characterizations: measures some property of the internet
      - Sometimes it's both
  - Key Ideas/Observations
    - 1-2 most important ideas
    - For mechanisms, the ideas behind the mechanisms
    - For characterizations, the key observations.
  - Flaws (1 or 2)
  - Open Questions (1 or 2)
    - Where can you take the research from here?
  - My Impressions
    - 1-2 sentences with your impression (is it good or not, why?)

  Your summaries must follow these sections exactly.  Some may be absent, but
  everything must have a section.  Due before class so we can discuss (submitted
  online via email in plain text).  Note that this is mostly a summary!  Your
  opinions on the paper only belong in the small "My Impressions" section.

   Some questions to ask about the paper, to identify flaws.

   - Can someone else replicate the results using the paper?
   - Are the assumptions clear enough?  (Careful, we're not assessing, just
     learning).  Do the assumptions potentially bias the paper?
   - Does the research eliminate alternative explanations of results?
   - Do conclusions follow logically from evidence.

   Dos and don'ts in paper summaries:

   - Not a review.
   - Inappropriate characterizations are "comprehensive", or "insufficient
     references".
   - This is what you need to remember 10 years from now.
   - Value conciseness.
   - Value specificity: focus on "how", not "what"

   Discussion guidelines:

   - Lecture for about 30-40 minutes.
     - Allocate 2 minutes per slide.  You expect they will be quicker, but
       usually your explanations.
   - Discussion for 30-40 minutes
   - Wrap up (5 mins)

   Grading:
   - 20% paper presentation.
   - 40% paper summaries
   - 10% class participation (attendance + discussions)
   - 30% final

   Office hours 2:40-3:40 Thursday, or by appointment.  Prefix email subject
   lines with "eecs600".

** Encryption and Authentication

   This content will be a brief overview of the basics.  Just enough for our
   subsequent discussions on security.

   Two varieties of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric

*** Symmetric encryption:
   - Two parties share a secret.
   - Encryption/decryption algorithms scramble/unscramble plaintext using the
     key.
   - Typically very fast, and the key is very small.
   - However, it is very difficult to distribute keys securely.

   Diffie-Hellman's protocol:

   1. Alice and Bob agree to use a prime number p and a base g (which have some
      properties we won't discuss).
   2. Alice chooses secret integer a, then sends Bob \(A = g^a \mod p\).  It
      turns out that it's very difficult to guess a from A.
   3. Bob chooses secret integer b, then sends Alice \(B = g^b \mod p\).
   4. Alice computes \(s = B^a \mod p = g^{ba} \mod p\)
   5. Bob computes \(s = A^b \mod p = g^{ab} \mod p\).
   6. Alice and Bob now share the secret \(s\).

   Invented in 1976!!

*** Asymmetric encryption

    - Pair of keys, (S,P).  You encrypt with one and decrypt with the other.
    - With asymmetric encryption, the key exchange is very similar.  We make one
      of our keys public, and we simply encrypt messages to others using their
      public keys.

    Two types of asymmetric key types:
    - RSA
      - Large (1-4 kbits)
      - Efficient
    - Elliptic curve
      - Small (about 160 bits)
      - Expensive

*** Uses of Encryption

    - Message Encryption - make it so that only owners of a key can read it.
    - Message Signature
      - Message may be distributed in the clear.
      - Only the key owner could have signed it.
      - Verifies authenticity and that the message has not been modified.

    Authentication (signing) using symmetric keys.

    1. Append the key to the message.
    2. Hash that to get a "message authentication code", and append that to your
       original message, and send it.
    3. Recipient can duplicate your actions and verify the message.

    Message Authentication using asymmetric keys

    1. Hash the message, and encrypt it with your private key.  Include that as
       the signature.
    2. Recipient can decrypt your signature using the public key, hash the
       message, and compare the two hashes.

    Interesting side note: the signature will necessarily be the same size as
    the asymmetric key, which is inconvenient for large keys.

    Sadly, with asymmetric keys, it's difficult to be certain that a key belongs
    to somebody (and isn't being spoofed).  So you need to get keys certified by
    a trusted third party.
