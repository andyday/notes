** Introductory Material

  I was late (and probably will be late frequently due to another class).
  Hopefully I didn't miss too much.

  Grading:
  - 30% paper presentation
  - 10% attendance, participation
  - 60% project

  Paper presentation:
  - Group of two
  - Present one or two papers.
  - Lead discussion.
  - May be helpful to read a few references.

  Project:
  - Best to come up with your own ideas, but he does have some ideas on his
    slides.
  - Project proposal (3-5 pages, due Feb 16) should include:
    - Title, idea, survey of related work, data source, key
      algorithms/technology, and what you expect to submit at the end of the
      semester.
  - Final report (1-20 pages, due April 21) must include:
    - Comprehensive description of your project
    - Project idea, extended survey of related work, result, etc.
    - What worked, what didn't work, what surprised you, etc.

  Data mining conferences:
  - ACM-SIGKDD
  - IEEE-ICDM
  - SIAM-DM
  - PKDD
  - PAKDD

  Journal:
  - Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery
  - KDD Explorations

  Other references can be found in the conferences and journals for the fields:
  - Database systems
  - Artificial Intelligence
  - Statistics
  - Bioinformatics

** Chapter 5
   *Mining Frequent Patterns, Association, and Correlations*

   - Original slides at: http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/homes/hanj/bk2/slidesindex.htm
     (broken link).
   - Frequent pattern analysis - finding items, subsequences, substructures,
     etc, that occur frequently in a data set.
     - Related - frequent itemsets, association rule mining
     - Agrawal, Imielinski, and Swami '93 introduced these ideas
   - Motivation is to find regularities, rules, etc that give you insight into
     data.  For instance:
     - Beer and diapers are frequently purchased together.
     - What are subsequent purchases after a PC?
   - Itemset: a set of items
   - k-itemset: an itemset containing k items
   - Call the set of all items \(I = \{I_1, \dots, I_m\}\)
   - \(T \subseteq I\) is a transaction, and has a transaction id.
   - An association rule is of the form \(A \to B\), with minimum support and
     confidence, where \(A \subset I\), \(B \subset I\), \(A \cap B =
     \emptyset\).
   - Support (for \(A \to B\)) is \(Pr[A \cup B \subseteq T]\).
     - That is, the probability that a transaction contains all of A and B.
     - As a percentage, also referred to as relative support.
     - As a number, referred to as the absolute support
   - Confidence (for \(A \to B\)) is \(Pr[B \subset T | A \subset T]\)
     - That is, the conditional probability that a transaction contains B, given
       it contains A.
     - \(Pr[B \subset T | A \subset T] = \frac{Pr[B \cup A \subseteq T]}{Pr[A
       \subset T]} = \frac{support(A \cup B)}{support(A)}\)
   - Confidence can be easily derived from the support of \(A\) and \(A \cup
     B\).  Which means you can "reduce" this problem to finding itemsets with
     high confidence, and then looking for disjoint pairs with high confidence.
   - Big patterns have lots of subsets, and therefore lots of other frequent
     patterns.  So, you want to find closed patterns and max-patterns.
   - Closed pattern: X is closed if X is frequent and there is no super-pattern
     \(Y \supset X\) with the same support as X.
   - An itemset X is a max-pattern if X is frequent and there is no frequent
     super-pattern \(Y \supset X\).
     - A "maximal" frequent super-pattern.
     - All max-patterns are closed.
